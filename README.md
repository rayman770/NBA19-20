## Introduction

**NOTE: In order to see the outputs along with the codes, please click NBA19-20.md file.**

This project talks about NBA 19-20 using RStudio package
‘SportsAnalytics’. Although some steps focus on only certain players or a team (Lakers, the champion of 19-20), it basically covers the whole league as well such as ranking by division/conference and comparing statistics. Please note that this project is meant to apply various R skills to the real world dataset rather than trying to professionally analyze basketball sports.

## Brief description of each step

1)  Loading the season data and extracting some meaningful statistics
    (field goals made, three points made, free throws made, total
    rebounds, total points)

2)  Subsetting data for LA Lakers only, the champion of 19-20 season,
    and finding the best player in terms of those meaningful statistics

3)  Showing five teams for the season that have the most wins in
    descending order by division and conference scraped from Wikipedia

4)  Six visualizations

<!-- end list -->

  - Comparing Eastern and Western conference in terms of the meaningful
    statistics (bar chart)
  - Fouls by position of top 5 Western teams (bar chart)
  - Number of views on NBA Finals by year (line chart)
  - Five NBA star players stat comparison (line chart)
  - Lakers 2020 starting lineup players stat comparison (radar chart)
  - Offensive rebounds vs. Defensive rebounds (scatter plot)

<!-- end list -->

5)  Displaying home locations of the last 10 champions using googleVis

6)  Simple Linear Regression Analysis
